The easiest way to get pgCodeKeeper is the update site: in an Eclipse instance running version 4.2 or higher, select Help> Install New Software ... The plug-in installation wizard will open with the update site.

In the Work With field, enter the path to the update site. It can be either a remote resource http://pgcodekeeper.ru/update/release/, or local to your file system.
After pressing Enter, the available plug-ins will appear in the list below.

Select the pgCodeKeeper package, agree to the installation, read the user agreement, click Finish, and the installation will begin.
